This version includes the following improvements:

* new, prettier help output format
* help output width now can be customised
* several bug fixes (concerning verification and trailing arguments
* "--" now serves as a switch to end optons parsing - everything after it is considered to be trailing arguments
* nested subcommands support

The library now goes into "stable" phase - that is, I will fix bugs, but won't add new ones, unless someone [asks me to](https://github.com/Rogach/scallop/issues/new?title=new%20feature).
